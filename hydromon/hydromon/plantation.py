"""Plantation-date tracking.

The grower sets a single plantation (transplant) date from the dashboard.
"Growth Days" (a.k.a. DAP - days after planting), which drives the
growth-stage-aware fuzzy TDS/pH bands in ``fuzzy.py``, is derived from it
instead of being typed in per-reading or sent by the ESP32. This removes a
value that was previously always wrong (the firmware never sent it, so it
silently defaulted to a fixed 14 on every single reading).
